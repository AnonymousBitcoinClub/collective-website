			<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
			<p>Bitcoin is a decentralized peer to peer network protocol developed out of the <a href="https://www.cypherpunkghosts.com/cypherpunkswritecode">Cypherpunks movement</a> which impelments a public digital ledger. The Bitcoin cryptocurrency exists without a central bank or single administrator, and can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.</p>
			<p>Bitcoin is often referred to as a cryptocurrency, as it uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions on the network.</p>
			<p>Bitcoin is a framework upon which efforts like the <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/">Ordinals Protocol</a> can be built, allowing for the creation and onchain storage of digital artifacts including art, games, documents, coding libraries and more.</p>

		<section id="how-it-works">
			<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<p>Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. The blockchain is maintained by a network of nodes, which validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.</p>
			<p>To send and receive Bitcoin, users need a digital wallet, which stores their private keys and allows them to interact with the network.</p>
