    <h1>Bitcoin Worms</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.bitcoinworms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit site</a>
      <strong>Bitcoin Worms</strong> started off as "WormE" short stories I would read my children. Eventually, this became a short children's book I made with my daughter, and the base design evolved into our PFP collection—secured on the God of all chains, Bitcoin!
    </p>

    <p>
      My idea started off simple: how can I let people inscribe my art at a low cost? The original PNGs were over 30kb—sometimes 15kb when reduced—which made them costly to inscribe.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I began learning basic programming, and discovered how to compress these down to 870 bytes—some even 640! This was a roaring success.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a rookie programmer, I built a site and opened it up to every degen on Twitter for several hours. After the session ended, I collected all submitted images, checked for duplicates, and launched what became the first stage in our journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a modest $2 average inscription fee in a moderate mempool, we inscribed 723 Bitcoin Worms—openly and fairly claimed by our 135 holders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each worm is an <code>.svg</code> file, built with structured code and layered images. The layers define a worm’s "Background", "Body", "Eyes", and "Mouth"—and are composed from on-chain 400x400 PNG base layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I left all my code open-source and have even helped others do the same. I welcome questions and encourage others to try making their own collections too!
    </p>

    <p>
      This has been a rewarding challenge, and I’m here to stay. Thanks for reading our little story so far 🪱.
